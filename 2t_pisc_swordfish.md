# A guide to 2t swordfish in Piscarilius

The 2t swordfish method is the meta for both pure fishing experience and the fishing pet. The are no requirements besides level 35 fishing to be able to harpoon at tuna and swordfish spots. At level 99, the fishing experience per hour is around 125k with a dragon harpoon and around 140k with a crystal harpoon. 

## Background

We'll be fishing in Port Piscarilius, which is the northeastern city in Zeah. Specifically, we'll be on the northwestern coast near the location indicator.

A convenient way to get to Port Piscarilius is using the book "Kharedst's memoirs", which is available after the quest The Queen of Thieves.

### Inventory and equipment

The only necessary gear to bring is a weapon with a two or three tick attack speed and a harpoon, strictly speaking. However, it's helpful to bring our angler's outfit for increased experience and runes to cast the spell confuse.

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/2pRl5X3.png" alt='Gear and inventory' width=400>

The harpoon can be any kind, but it's preferable to have at least a dragon harpoon, if not a crystal harpoon. Here we don't bring any ammo for our shortbow: this is make the method more forgiving to mistakes.

Since the weapon we brought was a magic shortbow, the attack option needs to be set to 'Rapid' to be 3 ticks. The other options make our attack speed be 4 ticks. With darts or a toxic blowpipe, the attack options don't matter, since all options are 2 or 3 ticks. Auto retaliate must be on while we are performing the method.

### Runelite settings

There's a few settings on runelite which make the method more comfortable.

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/dZi3T6g.png" alt='Menu entry swapper on' width=250>

Runelite's menu entry swapper plugin makes it possible to left click to fish tuna and swordfish. This is much more convenient than right clicking the fishing spot then selecting the appropriate option. As seen in the following sections, we've also tagged the rats through the NPC Indicator plugin to make finding them easier.

## Setup

In the section, we will set up the rats to attack us every other tick while we are in front of a fishing spot. [Here is a clip](https://i.imgur.com/TEygxQb.mp4) of full set up.

### Aggroing the rats

We use the spell Confuse to aggro the rats. Any combat spell could kill the rats since they have only two hitpoints. The two rats which tend to be in the areas in the clip below are the best to aggro; other rats have wander areas which we may sometimes leave.

### Every other ticking the rats

NOTE HYGER HAS FOUND A BETTER METHOD TO DO THIS, WILL UPDATE THE GUIDE LATER. YOU CAN FIND IT IN THE IRON SKILLING METHODS DISCORD.

Ultimately, we want the rats to be attacking us every other tick. To make this possible in a convenient way, we first make the rats horizontal. We run southward away from the coast, then run back in a way that avoids unobstructing the tile that the rat closest to us ends up on.

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/gHLDgJN.gif" alt='Making the rats horizontal' width=500>

There's exactly one possible configuration of rats (which typically won't occur in practice) that will not become horizontal when clicking in this way: however, if this running away then back to the coast doesn't work the first time, it will the second time. 

With the rats horizontal, we can now easily get them attacking us every other tick. On the tick when a hitsplat appears on our character, we will click the first highlighted tile. (Note, this is the only click during rat setup where our timing matters.) Then, we click the next highlighted tile to move the rabbits to the coast. Be sure to turn run off now.

## Main method

This is main part of doing 2t swordfish. Every two ticks, whenever a hitsplat appears on your character, we click on the fishing spot. The tick in between can be used for anything besides interacting with an object, item, npc, or player. Commonly, the tick is used to idle, drop fish, or fletch darts. Be sure to have auto-retaliate on.

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Gwqc6Q4.gif" alt='Main method' width=500>

The method works by being flinched for a one tick delay, then interacting with the fishing spot on the skilling tick. Since most fishing spots remove your interaction with them after one tick when the skilling tick isn't in the past, there's no need to click off like in 2t teaks. (Note, most fishing spots have one or two ticks which are exceptions to this that allow for afk fishing.)

The timing to spec without missing ticks is shown in the [clip here](https://streamable.com/4w6el). On a tick when we would have just interacted a fishing spot, we instead equip the harpoon, spec, and then interact with the fishing spot. On the next tick, we re-equip our 3t weapon, a shortbow.

## Movement

Movement must happen after setting up the rats and whenever the fishing spot moves. Since fishing spots block interaction with them for a few ticks before they move, a few ticks can be saved by noticing this and moving early. 

When our fishing spot moves westward, we can "pull" the rats to the new fishing spot. We click one tile away from the fishing spot, then click the fishing spot on the tick of the first hitsplat after arriving to the tile. (Clicking one tile away like this saves us a few ticks compared to just clicking the fishing spot or clicking the tile besides the fishing spot.)

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/JUkkVEk.gif" alt='Westward movement' width=500>

When our fishing spot moves eastward, just clicking near the fishing spot would path us through a rat, so we'd be "pushing" the rats. This can mess up their positioning, so instead we take a diagonal step to "pull" them. Again, we click one tile away from the fishing spot and then the fishing spot itself on the tick when a hitsplat first appears on our character after arriving.
